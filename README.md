# 🧠 LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my **solutions to LeetCode problems**, solved as part of my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** practice.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Strengthen DSA fundamentals
- Prepare for coding interviews and placements
