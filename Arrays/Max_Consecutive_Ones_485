Difficulty: Easy
Topic: Arrays

Problem Statement:
Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of
consecutive 1's in the array.

Approach:
- Traverse the array once
- Count consecutive 1's
- Reset count when a 0 is encountered
- Track the maximum count found

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
